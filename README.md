# NnFlightCoding

What started as an exercise to pass the time while in flight over the Atlantic, has begun the construction,
from scratch, of a functional Neural Net constructor.

I will endeavor to ensure that the simple command ``` Network.create ``` will show off the extent of this 
project's capacities. Please, feel free to fork and pick up wherever I leave off.

## Currently, 

It is fully functioning as a genotype generator. 

Furthermore, the genotype is automatically started in a process so that it can be accessed quickly, 
rather than passing it in each function call.

Neuron is processing stuff. Cool

```elixir
Network.create
```

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `nn_flight_coding` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:nn_flight_coding, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/nn_flight_coding](https://hexdocs.pm/nn_flight_coding).

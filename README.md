# NnFlightCoding

What started as an exercise to pass the time while in flight over the Atlantic, has begun the construction,
from scratch, of a functional Neural Net constructor.

It is very much a work in progress. As of yet, it is in the early phenotyping stage, but I'll update this as 
that changes. 

I will endeavor to ensure that the simple command ``` Network.create ``` will show off the extent of this 
project's capacities. Please, feel free to fork and pick up wherever I leave off.
